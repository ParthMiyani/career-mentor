### Benefits of this application will be: <br>
  * Students will get an idea about the stream in which they are good at.<br>
  * The result will be based purely on the test which the student gives and hence, it will be totally unbiased result.<br>
  * It will help students to select the career path in their life.<br>
### Main aim and the objectives:<br>
<p>
  In this project, we will develop an Expert System which will predict the stream for a student. For this purpose, we will use Decision tree algorithm on dataset consisting of Psychometric questions. Generally a student who has passed 10th standard remains confused regarding which stream to choose i.e., Science (Mathematics or Biology), Commerce or Arts. The main aim of this system is to provide a particular stream to a student in which he/she can pursue his/her career. In this way our system can help all those students who need some assistance in choosing stream for further studies.

### Materials and methods used 
* Flutter 
* Python 
* Firebase 
* Android Studio 

<p>
  Method The User Interface of the App has been implemented in Android Studio using Flutter Framework by Google. In Flutter, Dart programming language has been used.
The database which we have used to access data i.e. questionnaire is a real-time database of firebase.The next part of the application is how the questions will come one after another according to the answer given by the user for previous question. This thing is implemented using Decision Tree for Knowledge based Expert System.After the evaluation is done there is a need to store the test data of user into database. For this purpose, weâ€™re using Google Sheets as a repository to store the data
